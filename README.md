# girlbandcrysong
This is my personal project to analyze the song from the anime "Girl Band Cry" song.

Girl Band Cry is my favorite anime including many emotional song,and well written character.
In this project, I'd like to analyze the song from this anime to see top view and like from the youtube channel "GIRLS BAND CRY Channel" and some audio from the Topic channel using selenium library, and some AI tools to support. And finally, I've created the dashboard with the Looker Studio, you can see it [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/a03cb00c-a8a5-4daa-9edf-fa28696d7543)
